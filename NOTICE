Major modifications in this fork:
- Refactored into modular architecture with separate core, solvers, mpc, lqr, qp, and utils modules
- Added class-based trajectory optimizer interface with TrajectoryOptimizer protocol
- Implemented multiple QP solver backends (OSQP, Clarabel, CVXPY, ProxQP)
- Created unified MPC controller interface with warm starting and relinearization
- Enhanced LQR module with Riccati equation solvers
- Integrated SQP solver from experimental into main solvers module
- Created legacy compatibility layer for backward compatibility
